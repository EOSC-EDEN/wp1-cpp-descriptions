# wp1-cpp-descriptions
This repository contains the descriptions of the 30 [Core Preservation Processes](https://zenodo.org/records/16992452). Currently in PDF format, they will be converted to a machine-actionable format in the near future.

Feedback is sought by the Work Package 1 Task 1.2 group both on the structure and the content of the CPP descriptions. Depending on whether your observation applies globally / to several CPPs, or to a specific part of a CPP, feedback is expected in this Github repository or in individual Google Docs:
