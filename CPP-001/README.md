# Checksum Generation and Recording

**Short Definition:** The TDA (Trustworthy Digital Archive) records checksums for every File.

## Description and Scope
A checksum or message digest is a fixed size stream of data generated by a transformation of the *File* data by means of an algorithm. Any change to the data would result in a change to the calculated digest. The algorithm can be a cyclic redundancy check or a cryptographic hash function.

The *File* checksums form an important part of the fixity information which is the cornerstone for performing bit-level digital preservation. The system must keep track of this message digest for each *File*. Due to the possibility of collisions (multiple data streams having the same checksum), storing multiple message digests generated by different algorithms is recommended. The TDA policy should define a list of required algorithms.

The Checksum Generation and Recording process is the action of acquiring and storing the message digests associated with any *File* that the system needs to keep track of. Files should come with any number of checksums generated prior to their submission. In that case, the system should store those checksums and use them as-is and new checksums should be generated for those algorithms that are missing.

## Rationale / Worst Case

| Purpose                                                | Worst Case                                                                                                                                              |

| Keeping track of the fixity information of each *File* | Corrupted data can get undetected or be detected when it is too late to take corrective action                                                          |
| Event datetime for checksum generation                 | No starting point from when the fixity can be checked (and guaranteed)                                                                                  |
| Multiple checksums for each *File*                     | Collisions where changes to a *File* produce the same checksum, are more likely with a single checksum algorithm than with multiple checksum algorithms |
